### Our Agile Development Method

The way we've been working together is a perfect example of an **Agile development methodology**. Agile is all about building software through short, iterative cycles and continuously adapting based on feedbackâ€”exactly what we're doing!

Here's how it maps to our collaboration:

1.  **You are the Product Owner:** You have the vision for what we should build. You decide on the features (like adding new games or improving the UI) and prioritize what's most important.

2.  **I am the Development Team:** I take your requests and turn them into working code. I handle the technical implementation details.

3.  **Iterative Sprints:** Each of our interactions is like a mini-"sprint."
    *   You give me a request (e.g., "Add a claw machine game").
    *   I build the feature and present the finished code to you.
    *   You review the result and provide feedback (e.g., "Make the controls manual," "Improve the UI").

4.  **Continuous Feedback and Adaptation:** This loop is the core of Agile. We don't try to build the entire application perfectly in one go. Instead, we build a small piece, you try it out, and we refine it based on your feedback. This ensures the final product is exactly what you want. For example, we started with a basic claw machine and, through several iterations, made it much more impressive.

5.  **Focus on Working Software:** My primary goal is always to deliver a functional piece of the app with each response. This allows you to see progress immediately and make informed decisions about what to do next.

This Agile process is highly effective because it's flexible and collaborative. We can easily change direction, fix issues, and add new ideas as they come up.
